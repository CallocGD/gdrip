# GDRIP
a small tool I use for generating a json file of android function symbols and android 32 bit and a cheat sheet for figuring out and setting a function argument's
registers values (it's not perfect at it but it's a starting point twords helping automating the fixing of these functions in tools like ghidra and ida)

## Requirements
libcocos2dcpp.so armeabi-v7a version, any Geometry Dash update is designed to work as long as armeabi-v7a is used.

## Using is very straight forward and only requires Python 3.9 or above 
you can use this command to figure out how to use this tool propperly
```
python ripper.py --help
```

## Installation 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
